## Project Proposal
Biosync is a patient management application that allows medical professionals to efficiently view <br> 
and update patient medical records, as well as track patient progress. 

Biosync aims to provide support for giving patients timely services and care, and given the limited amount of medical 
resources <br> and psychiatrists available, it can especially be useful in mental health care. Mental health treatment 
is a prolonged and <br> arduous process that requires multiple patient-psychiatrist sessions and 
trials to identify effective medications and therapies. <br> As such, Biosync can, for example, be integrated into more 
sophisticated mental health related applications such as MindTalk, <br> a research project that my group is 
developing, which aims to objectivize and expedite depression diagnosis and treatment.
